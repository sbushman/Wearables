This is the readme for the JHU assignment on wearables, as part of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.


The data set is 'as_is', with the following assumptions:  
1.  It all sits in a sub_directory called 'Wearables.'
2.  I renamed the directory under that 'UCI_HAR_Dataset' ('with underscores') from 'UCI Har Dataset'.  
3.  Reading most documents can be done on your side by adjusting the 'rpath' variable 



Enjoy!
